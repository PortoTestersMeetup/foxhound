  title: "Lead Mobile Tester"
  bio: "Hi, my name is Daniel Knott and I am a passionate software tester since 2008. In my career I worked for companies from different industries such as IBM, Accenture, XING and AOE. In different agile projects I gained strong knowledge in different areas of software testing e.g. mobile, search and recommendation technologies, web and desktop applications. Since 2011, I am the blogger of this blog and publish posts about software testing, mobile testing and any other kind of interesting topics around software development. If I find the time, I am also a speaker at testing conferences and quality assurance articles. An overview of my publications can be found here. In 2014, I published my first book about mobile testing. The title of the book is “Hands-On Mobile App Testing” and can be purchased on http://www.handsonmobileapptesting.com/. In the beginning of 2016, Daniel released a new eBook called “Smartwatch App Testing” and is published at https://leanpub.com/smartwatchapptesting."
